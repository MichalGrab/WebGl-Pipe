# WebGl-Pipe

- Pipe dimensions can be changed by typing number into the form fields or by using mouse wheel

- A pipe can be rotated by clicking and moving of the mouse. Rotation sometimes causes unwanted shape changes, it should be investigatedand corrected.  

- Many internet sources was used during work, but mostly: webglfundamentals.org, stackoverflow.com and MDN documentation for JavaScript language

- Buffer test still doesn't work as I expect, so it's disabled now, it can be seen while looking for back ring of the pipe
